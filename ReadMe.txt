Student Management System - OOPD Assignment 3

Build Instructions:
- To compile the program, open your terminal and run:
  make
- To execute the program after compiling, run:
  ./main
- To clean compiled files and executable, run:
  make clean

Project Overview:
This project is a simple yet effective Student Management System showcasing key object-oriented programming concepts such as polymorphism, operator overloading, and exception handling. It manages students enrolled in various programs including BTech, MTech, and PhD within a well-structured class hierarchy for flexibility.

Key Features:
- Add new student records including roll number, branch (CSE or ECE), and full name.
- Modify student marks using operator overloading for intuitive access.
- Automatic calculation of total marks and corresponding student grades.
- Sort students by roll number, total marks, or alphabetically by name using a Trie data structure.
- Comprehensive input validation with exception handling for format errors and buffer overflow.

Technical Details:
The project is developed using modern C++17 standards and is modularly designed for ease of maintenance and extension. It ensures efficient student record management and robust error handling.

Usage:
Follow the build instructions above to compile and run the system. Use the menu-driven interface to add students, modify marks, and view sorted lists.

This project fulfills the requirements of the OOPD Assignment 3, providing a solid demonstration of advanced programming practices in C++.
